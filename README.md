## Industry: Fashion & Apparel

## Project Overview:
Trendy is a rapidly growing eCommerce fashion retailer offering a diverse collection of clothing and accessories for both men and women. Despite having a strong product range and a growing customer base, Trendy faced challenges with improving key eCommerce metrics such as conversion rates, cart abandonment, and average order value (AOV). As a result, the client engaged me to conduct a comprehensive audit and implement a data-driven strategy to optimize their website for greater customer conversion and revenue growth.


## Business Objectives:
   ** Increase conversion rates and average order value (AOV)
   
   ** Reduce cart abandonment at the checkout stage
   
   ** Gain actionable insights into customer behavior and  website performance
   
   ** Improve mobile conversion and user experience
   
   ** Enhance marketing ROI through better segmentation and data analysis
   
   ** Creating Dashboard for Tracking Metrics

## Challenges: 
    High Cart Abandonment:  A significant number of users were adding products to the cart  but leaving without completing the purchase.
    
 Poor Conversion Rates: Despite good traffic, the website struggled to convert visitors into 
paying customers.

Fragmented Data Insights: The client had limited visibility into customer behavior and key performance indicators (KPIs), making it difficult to make informed marketing and optimization decisions.

Mobile Optimization: The mobile version of the site was not optimized, resulting in lower conversions on mobile devices.

Inefficient Checkout Process: The checkout process was long, complex, and lacked trust signals, leading to cart abandonment at the final stage.
