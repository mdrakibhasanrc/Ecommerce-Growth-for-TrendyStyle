# Ecommerce-Growth-for-TrendyStyle

## Client: Trendy_Fashion Ecommerce Platform
## Industry: Fashion & Apparel
## Tools & Technology Used: GA4, Bigquery, SQL, DBT, Looker Studio, Power BI, Microsoft Clarity

## Project Overview:
Trendy is a rapidly growing eCommerce fashion retailer offering a diverse collection of clothing and accessories for both men and women. Despite having a strong product range and a growing customer base, Trendy faced challenges with improving key eCommerce metrics such as conversion rates, cart abandonment, and average order value (AOV). As a result, the client engaged me to conduct a comprehensive audit and implement a data-driven strategy to optimize their website for greater customer conversion and revenue growth.


## Business Objectives:
   ** Increase conversion rates and average order value (AOV)
   
   ** Reduce cart abandonment at the checkout stage
   
   ** Gain actionable insights into customer behavior and  website performance
   
   ** Improve mobile conversion and user experience
   
   ** Enhance marketing ROI through better segmentation and data analysis
   
   ** Creating Dashboard for Tracking Metrics

## Challenges: 


     High Cart Abandonment:  A significant number of users were adding products to the cart  but 
     leaving without completing the purchase.
     
     Poor Conversion Rates: Despite good traffic, the website struggled to convert visitors into 
     paying customers.

     Fragmented Data Insights: The client had limited visibility into customer behavior and key 
     performance indicators (KPIs), making it difficult to make informed marketing and 
     optimization decisions.

     Mobile Optimization: The mobile version of the site was not optimized, resulting in lower 
     conversions on mobile devices.

     Inefficient Checkout Process: The checkout process was long, complex, and lacked trust 
     signals, leading to cart abandonment at the final stage.


## Solution: A 3-Step Approach:
To address the challenges and achieve the clientâ€™s goals, I employed a 3-step approach:

      I) Data Analytics
      
      II) Powerful Reporting & Insight
      
      III) Conversion Rate Optimization Audit & Recomendetion.

 This approach was designed to uncover actionable insights, provide the client with clear performance metrics, and drive tangible improvements in eCommerce performance.


## Step 1: Data Analytics:

The first step was to gather and analyze all available data to uncover critical insights into customer behavior, conversion trends, and website performance. This process laid the foundation for the CRO strategies that followed.

  ### Data Integration & Analysis: 
  
        I) Data Integration:Set up Google Analytics 4 (GA4) and integrated it with BigQuery to 
           collect and analyze website traffic, user behavior, and product performance data. This 
           integration allowed for more advanced queries and deeper analysis of user journeys

       II) Customer Segmentation: Used Custom SQL Query, and DBT to segment customers into cohorts 
           based on their behavior (new vs. returning customers, high-value vs. low-value 
           customers). This  helped to understand purchasing patterns and areas for retention and 
           upselling.

      III) Funnel Analysis: Conducted a funnel analysis to identify where users were dropping off 
           in the conversion  process. Using GA4 and BigQuery, I tracked key user interactions, 
           from landing pages to  checkout completion. 

      IV) Funnel Analysis: Combined heatmaps from Hotjar and session recordings to visually 
          understand user interactions on key pages. Insights showed that users were not scrolling 
          past the first two product images on certain product pages, suggesting that these pages 
          could benefit from better engagement tactics (e.g., interactive images, videos, or 
           enhanced  descriptions).
